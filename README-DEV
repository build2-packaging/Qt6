1. The upstream build

Qt5's qmake build has been completely converted to cmake in Qt6.

Scripts in upstream/qtbase/util/cmake/ were used to convert much of the Qt5
build into CMake files. For example, configurejson2cmake.py was used to
convert the Qt5 configure.json files to configure.cmake for each module, and
the Qt5 qmake project files (.pro, .pri) were converted to CMakeLists.txt
using the pro2cmake.py script.

1.1 Upstream build documentation

- https://wiki.qt.io/Qt6_Build_System (not much there at the time of writing,
  however).

1.2 Configuration system

A module's features are defined in qtbase/src/<module>/configure.cmake as
follows:

  qt_feature("<feature-name>" <visibility>...)

This results in definitions like the following in the module config header
(public or private, depending on the visibility):

  #define QT_FEATURE_foo  1 // Enabled feature
  #define QT_FEATURE_bar -1 // Disabled feature

Upstream code checks for features using the QT_CONFIG() macro defined in
qtconfigmacros.h. Every feature "foo" thus tested must have a corresponding
`#define QT_FEATURE_foo {1,-1}` in one of the module
config headers, otherwise there will be a compilation error.

Some features have associated macros that are defined only if the features is
either enabled or disabled. These are always defined in the public module
config header. Then there are "extra" macros which are standalone and can be
defined in the public or private module config header.

These macros are defined using the following functions:

qt_feature_definition(<feature-name> <macro-name>): Define a
                                                    feature-associated macro
                                                    in the public module
                                                    config header
                                                    conditionally based on the
                                                    enabled value of the
                                                    feature.

qt_extra_definition(<macro-name> PUBLIC|PRIVATE): Define a macro in the public
                                                  or private module config
                                                  header.

1.2.1 Downstream module configuration headers

Because we manage these headers manually we have automated the process of
checking that we haven't missed any features or macros defined upstream. This
is necessary because there are currently more than 400 of them and Qt6 is
still being actively developed so features and macros will be added, removed,
and moved (for example, from the public to the private header).

The `check-config-header` script prints all features and macros not handled
both upstream and downstream. Therefore, in order for it to produce usable
output, it is necessary to put every single feature and macro defined upstream
in our downstream headers. Note however that commented-out features and macros
are treated identically to uncommented ones so not every feature and macro
needs to actually be defined.

Many features defined upstream are not actually referenced by any code. These
are typically only used internally by the upstream build. We prefer to leave
these features/macros commented out because this makes it clear that the
feature/macro is unused and obviates the need to have to figure out under what
conditions it should be enabled and writing the additional code that that
would require.

Recommended ordering of features and macros within a downstream module config
header:

- Application/user-level features
  For example: scrollbars.

- Internal Qt library-level features
  For example: threads, concurrent, appstore_compliant.

- Dependencies
  For example: zstd, glib, icu.

- Build-related
  For example: shared, static, debug_and_release, cross_compile, framework

- C and C++ language features
  For example: c99, cxx17, cxx11_filesystem

- Low-level implementation and platform-specific details
  For example: largefile support, signaling_nan, SSE, AVX, AES.

Divergences from upstream

Although QT_CONFIG() is not available in qconfig.h and qtcore-config.h by
default (because qglobal.h includes them before the header that defines
QT_CONFIG(), qtconfigmacros.h), we put our own definition in qconfig.h so that
we can consistently use QT_CONFIG across all module config headers. Although
upstream clearly didn't intend for this macro to be used in the module config
headers, its downstream use is necessary because testing QT_FEATURE_foo macros
directly would just be too verbose and error prone.

Private features that have an associated macro are moved to the public
header. Otherwise the feature macro and its associated macro would be in
different headers which would make manual maintenance impractical. The
associated macro is only defined if the feature is either enabled or disabled
and we'd otherwise not be able express this relationship programmatically
because private features are not available in the public module config
headers. We'd also have to document the relationship between the feature and
its associated macro using comments and add cross-references to the public and
private headers. Furthermore, it seems that if you need a public macro
QT_NO_FOO which is defined if a private feature QT_FEATURE_foo is disabled
then the feature is not really very private anymore as one half of its
potential values are already exposed. I don't think making such features
public downstream is taking it much further. When the feature and associated
macro are in the same header everything is completely clear:

  #define QT_FEATURE_jpeg 1 // Moved from private
  #if !QT_CONFIG(jpeg)
  #  define QT_NO_IMAGEFORMAT_JPEG 1
  #endif

The "Moved from private" comment tells the `check-config-header` script to not
report the feature as being in the downstream public header (otherwise it
would look like a public feature that was removed from upstream). To prevent
`check-config-header` from reporting it as a missing private feature, also
keep it in the private header, but commented out, with a "Moved to public"
comment for the sake of human readers:

  // #define QT_FEATURE_jpeg 1 // Moved to public

In the upstream module feature configuration files (for example,
upstream/qtbase/src/gui/configure.cmake), the `PUBLIC PRIVATE` visibility spec
causes a feature to be defined in both the public and private module headers
(presumably to cause public features to be automatically pulled in when the
private features are included).

However, we treat `PUBLIC PRIVATE` and `PRIVATE PUBLIC` merely as public (that
is, we do not duplicate these features into both the public and private module
config headers) for the following reasons:

1) It's not clear that the `PUBLIC PRIVATE` scheme is even necessary. I asked
   one of the developers who works on the cmake build on IRC what its purpose
   is (in light of the points below) and even he couldn't tell me.

   As far back as Qt5 the upstream intention has clearly been that the module
   config headers should be included only via the corresponding module global
   header:

   Firstly, there are only a handful of places outside of the module global
   headers where a module config header is included directly, but hundreds
   where a global module header is included.

   Secondly, every module's private global header includes its private module
   config header and its public global header, which includes the public
   module config header. (For example, qtwidgetsglobal_p.h includes
   qtwidgets-config_p.h, and qtwidgetsglobal.h, which includes
   qtwidgets-config.h.) Thus the public features are automatically pulled in
   when the private features are included. Including the private module config
   headers directly would defeat this scheme.

   So the automatic pulling in of public features when private features are
   included was already covered by the global module header scheme for a long
   time.

2) Because we manage the module config headers manually it would be very
   tedious to keep every feature duplicated in both files and it would also
   make reading those files much more difficult.

For these reasons we diverge from upstream by including the public module
config header from the private one instead of duplicating `PUBLIC PRIVATE`
features in both headers.

1.4 How to identify sources to be moc'd

grep -REl 'Q_OBJ|Q_GADGET|Q_NAMESPACE' upstream/qtbase/src/<module>

This will include headers and source files (C++ and Objective-C++). The
transformations are as follows:

  `moc foo.hpp` produces moc_foo.cpp
  `moc foo.cpp` produces foo.moc (a C++ source file)
  `moc foo.mm`  produces foo.moc (note: also a C++ source file)

Most moc outputs are included, but some are compiled.

- Find included header moc outputs:

    grep -REh 'include.+moc_.+\.cpp' upstream/qtbase/src/<module>

- Find included source file moc outputs:

    grep -REh 'include.+\.moc' upstream/qtbase/src/<module>

- Find compiled moc outputs (from within the upstream build directory):

    find . -type f -name mocs_compilation.cpp -exec grep -h '#include' {} \;

2. TODO upon upstream upgrade

2.1. Upgrade upstream/qtbase/ to the latest release.

2.2. Check whether upstream versions of any files in downstream/ have changed.

Print all files under downstream/ that have changed upstream since the last
release (using version 6.4.1 in this example):

  $ ./find-outdated-patches v6.4.1
  qtbase/src/tools/moc/generator.cpp
  qtbase/src/tools/moc/main.cpp
  qtbase/src/corelib/thread/qmutex.cpp
  qtbase/src/corelib/compat/removed_api.cpp
  qtbase/src/corelib/serialization/qcborstreamreader.cpp

Then make use of something like `git add --patch` to merge the new upstream
changes and our downstream patches:

  $ cp {upstream,downstream}/qtbase/src/tools/moc/generator.cpp
  $ git add --patch downstream/qtbase/src/tools/moc/generator.cpp

2.3 Run the generate script.

2.4. Ensure resource collection files (.qrc) have not changed.

In the upstream build all of the .qrc files are generated by cmake. We use
copies of the upstream-generated ones but usually they need to be edited (for
example, to make absolute paths relative).

To generate the .qrc files, simply run cmake on the upstream build:

  $ mkdir qt6-build
  $ cd qt6-build
  $ cmake ~/work/build2-packaging/Qt6/upstream/qtbase
  $ find . -name \*.qrc
  ./src/gui/.rcc/qpdf.qrc
  ./src/gui/.rcc/gui_shaders.qrc
  ./src/widgets/.rcc/qstyle1.qrc
  ./src/widgets/.rcc/qstyle.qrc
  ./src/widgets/.rcc/qmessagebox.qrc

2.5. Check version scripts

Ensure that our copied version scripts still match the upstream-generated
ones.

Currently the only one is
libQt6Gui/QtGuiPlugins/platforms/xcb/QtXcbQpa.version. Although it is very
simple (it does nothing but put all symbols inside the Qt_6 version node --
that is, it does not restrict the visibility of any symbols -- it is generated
by the upstream build so it's best to check that nothing important has
changed.

Generate the upstream version script with the following command (assuming the
build directory is ./qt6-build/):

  make -C qt6-build XcbQpaPrivate_version_script

This will generate qt6-build/src/plugins/platforms/xcb/XcbQpaPrivate.version.

2.6. Check for new or removed Qt configuration features and macros

Run the `check-config-header` script for all modules. For example:

check-config-header --module global --visibility pub
check-config-header --module global --visibility priv
check-config-header --module core   --visibility pub
check-config-header --module core   --visibility priv

etc.

This script prints the names of features and macros that are not handled both
upstream and downstream, so this list will include features and macros added
or removed by the upstream upgrade. Update the downstream module config
headers indicated by the module and visibility options passed as required (see
the script itself for the list of headers).
